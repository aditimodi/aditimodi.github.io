I am a climate scientist at the *Centre for Climate Change Research, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, India*. I explore **biophysical interactions in tropical oceans**, combining statistical methods and machine learning. I'm also part of the team developing the **IITM earth system model (IITM-ESM) for CMIP7**. Additionally, I serve as an adjunct faculty member for **Advanced physical oceanography and ocean-atmosphere Interactions** at the WMO's Regional Meteorological Training Centre in India. I have done my engineering (B.Tech) in *Civil Engineering* from *A.P.J. Abdul Kalam University, Lucknow* in India.

Apart from work, I indulge in several creative tasks, the most consistent ones among them would be reading (on diverse subjects), scientific communication and travel.
