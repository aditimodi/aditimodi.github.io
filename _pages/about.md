I am a climate scientist at the *Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, India*. I hold a Ph.D. in Climate Sciences from IIT Bombay. My research focuses on understanding how climate change affects marine ecosystems in tropical oceans. I am a key contributor to the development of the **IITM Earth System Model (IITM-ESM) for CMIP7**â€”the first climate model from South Asia.

In addition to my research, I have served as an adjunct faculty member for **Advanced Physical Oceanography and Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions** at the WMO's Regional Meteorological Training Centre in India. Presently, I lead the Early Career Scientist Network of the International Indian Ocean Expedition Phase 2, fostering collaboration among young scientists from Indian Ocean rim nations to study and safeguard the Indian Ocean.

Outside of my professional work, I enjoy reading about different topics, communicating science, and traveling.
